# Undertale text tracker
This is a tool I used to track which strings I've seen in Undertale

The end result string list can be found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/5isw08/ive_seen_all_the_text_in_undertale/) or generated by running the program.

Included is the tracking program, a list of strings which can be unpacked after extracting from the "data.win" game file, and two autoclicker scripts I used to help me play the game quicker- one to skip dialogue and one to fast-start a new game.
## Notes
All of these strings were seen in game through legitimate means aside from moving files and using CheatEngine for some things.

The save name is the last place I saved at when I got the string, although not necessarily in that area (especially for all the papyrus / undyne phone calls, plus other ones labeled "... - The End"). The different numbers in the hierarchy are different attempts/runs starting from that save point. When backtracking I just used the furthest-in-the-game save point I had saved at. I split attempts at game-over screens, but not every new attempt means a game-over, nor does a new attempt mean only one attempt since the preceding one. Saves without any new text strings were omitted from the hierarchy which is why there are big gaps between adjacent saves in the hierarchy.

Most of the strings appear in the order I saw them, a small number were moved to appropriate places (like battle text), and few strings (like item names in battles) were added long after the first time I saw them due to forgetting to add them or otherwise not noticing them.

Not included are the exact locations where the strings can be found or who said them.

For some strings that are either completely identical or nearly identical with only differences in pauses or facial expressions, I made guesses as to which strings were used.

TPTE3  | True Pacifist (places to go)

Times I used Cheat Engine:
* Refighting monsters/bosses if I already defeated them with the same armor/weapon/HP/battle strategy (kill/spare)/etc. (ATK, my HP, their HP, Karma, Mettaton rating)
* Adding money for things or removing money for things

Notable death counts (including post-screw-up-suicides):
* Undyne the Undying: 123 (5 hours) (without healing)
* Sans: 161 (10 hours) (with 3 snowman pieces, 2 astronaut food, 1 glamburger, and pie)
* Asgore: 18 (LV 1 + bandage + no consumables for Sans' "challenge yourself" comment, although butterscotch pie in the battle wouldn't have prevented it) (not counting previous endings fighting him)
* Times I touched the credits: 5

Notable things that I had gotten spoiled:
* Before I started playing:
    * Toriel was the queen (though I had forgotten this by the time I played until remembering sometime during the first Neutral route)
    * Frisk name
    * Chara is the first fallen human, destroys the world in genocide, and affects future True Pacifist endings
* Before experiencing in-game:
    * Asriel is the king's son
    * Flowey is Asriel
    * Alphys made Amalgamates through experiments (though I didn't know anything more until going through the True Pacifist route)

Times I manipulated save files other than simply restoring them:
* Second Genocide (only required reloading the end)

Resets:
* NLTE2 -> NTNPS1
* GTE1 -> NPS9

Strings I did not mark/see in-game (I've read everything through the text dump):
* Some similar-looking duplicates of strings I've seen
* Some "..." strings (often hard to tell which is the one being used)
* Almost any string without a lot of visible text
* Possibly some "X appeared" battle intro quotes, they're either rare or just truly unused
* Any error-handling strings, strings from unused monster battles, strings requiring editing the save file, or strings otherwise unobtainable through normal gameplay

Other text notes:
* The Snowed Inn keeper's "What? No, you can't get a second key!" happens if you press Z+X really quickly while the screen is fading before you go to the room
* Hanging out with Payprus while wearing Temmie armor triggers "THAT THING ON YOUR BODY" which seems to be an error-handling message
* Papyrus' hangout strings "GO AHEAD! OPEN IT!" and "EAT THIS! MY ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE!!!" seem to technically appear but only the first letter shows up before being replaced by different text
* I could not get Muffet's "only sold one donut" text even without ever giving her money

Other notes:
* Photoshop Flowey has 9950 HP
* All values are stored as doubles
* Karma is 0 for no purple, positive for some purple
